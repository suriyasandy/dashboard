Jira Task Title:

Set Up and Validate Reuters & Bloomberg API Connectivity

⸻

Description:

Implement secure connectivity and data extraction pipeline for Reuters and Bloomberg platforms. The task involves handling authentication, proxy configuration, certificate-based access, and ensuring successful data retrieval through APIs.

⸻

Sub-tasks:
	1.	Reuters Connectivity
	•	Configure OAuth 2.0 authentication flow (client ID/secret-based)
	•	Set up proxy configuration to handle corporate network restrictions
	•	Implement token generation logic using requests.post with required headers and payload
	•	Handle job submission for TickHistoryIntradaySummariesExtractRequest
	•	Retrieve jobID, poll job status, and extract final compressed raw data using download URL
	•	Validate data output (e.g., time series consistency, record count, compression integrity)
	2.	Bloomberg Connectivity
	•	Load .p12 certificate using Java (KeyStore) and Python (pkcs12 via cryptography)
	•	Configure SSL context with certificate and private key for HTTPS calls
	•	Set up SOCKS or HTTP proxy with proxy host, port, username, and password
	•	Integrate with Bloomberg REST API using requests (Python) or HttpsURLConnection (Java)
	•	Validate token request and service endpoint access
	•	Test a basic data retrieval (e.g., historical tick or reference data)
	3.	Common Tasks
	•	Prepare configuration module with separate entries for UAT/PROD endpoints, credentials, headers
	•	Develop reusable utilities for:
	•	Token retrieval
	•	Job submission and polling
	•	SSL context loading from .p12
	•	Log all requests/responses with masking of sensitive info
	•	Handle common error codes (e.g., 407 Proxy Auth, SSL errors, timeouts)

⸻

Acceptance Criteria:
	•	Reuters and Bloomberg APIs successfully authenticated and able to return historical data
	•	Proxy and SSL configurations are reusable and abstracted from business logic
	•	Retry logic for job polling implemented for robustness
	•	All configuration parameters externalized (e.g., via config file or environment variables)

⸻

Attachments:
	•	Reuters WSDL or API Docs
	•	Bloomberg .p12 sample (dummy)
	•	Sample response files for Reuters and Bloomberg (if available)
