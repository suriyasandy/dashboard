üéôÔ∏è GFX Threshold Deviation Dashboard ‚Äì Audio Demo Summary

This dashboard addresses a key challenge in trade surveillance: calibrating deviation thresholds effectively across currencies and legal entities. Too many alerts create noise, while loose thresholds risk missing true issues. The dashboard offers an end-to-end solution for threshold analysis, impact assessment, and exception mapping.

‚∏ª

1. Why This Dashboard?

It enables users to:
	‚Ä¢	Reduce false positives by tuning thresholds.
	‚Ä¢	Evaluate the effect of threshold changes before applying them.
	‚Ä¢	Align alerts with real exceptions using exception data analysis.

‚∏ª

2. Data Ingestion
	‚Ä¢	Trade data from UAT and PROD is downloaded using OAuth APIs.
	‚Ä¢	Each file is named and stored by product type, legal entity, and date.
	‚Ä¢	UAT records are filtered to retain only those present in PROD.
	‚Ä¢	Out-of-scope records are removed using alert descriptions.
	‚Ä¢	Exception data is fetched for a selected date range.

‚∏ª

3. Threshold Management
	‚Ä¢	Users upload threshold files containing original and proposed values.
	‚Ä¢	Choose between group-wise or currency-wise thresholding.
	‚Ä¢	Editable tables allow adjusting thresholds within the UI.
	‚Ä¢	Update or reset changes dynamically.

‚∏ª

4. Impact Analysis
	‚Ä¢	On clicking ‚ÄúRun Impact Analysis‚Äù, each trade is compared against the maximum threshold between its two currencies.
	‚Ä¢	Summary output shows total volume and alert counts under:
	‚Ä¢	Original thresholds
	‚Ä¢	Proposed thresholds
	‚Ä¢	Adjusted thresholds
	‚Ä¢	Displayed by Legal Entity and Source System.

‚∏ª

5. Exception & Reason Code Mapping
	‚Ä¢	Selecting a summary row triggers exception analysis.
	‚Ä¢	High-level exception codes are shown by business date.
	‚Ä¢	Clicking a code reveals detailed reason code breakdowns.
	‚Ä¢	Helps validate threshold tuning against actual exceptions.

‚∏ª

6. Deviation Bucket Summaries
	‚Ä¢	Groupwise Buckets: Automatically created using adjusted thresholds; highlights trades beyond max thresholds.
	‚Ä¢	Expanded Buckets: Fixed bin sizes for high-deviation trades; useful for analyzing outliers.
	‚Ä¢	Both summaries support:
	‚Ä¢	Dual-currency mapping
	‚Ä¢	Pivoting
	‚Ä¢	Filtering
	‚Ä¢	Download

7. Final Impact

This dashboard empowers compliance and surveillance teams to:
	‚Ä¢	Fine-tune thresholds with data-backed confidence.
	‚Ä¢	Understand how changes affect alert volumes.
	‚Ä¢	Align threshold settings with operational realities.
